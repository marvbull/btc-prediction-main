# 📈 Bitcoin Price Prediction

## 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **Bitcoin price prediction model** using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook**.  
The goal was to analyze historical price data and build a model capable of predicting future Bitcoin prices using machine learning techniques.

It combines **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **model training** into a coherent notebook-based workflow.  
Key focus areas include **trend analysis**, **model selection**, and **prediction accuracy**.


## 📂 Repository Structure

- `bitcoin-prediction.ipynb` – Main notebook with all code, analysis, and results  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **XGBoost**
- **Pandas / NumPy** – Data handling and preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Visualization  
- **scikit-learn** – Model building and evaluation  
- **Datetime tools** – Time-series alignment and transformation


## 🧠 Model Strategy

The notebook walks through the following steps:

1. Load and clean historical Bitcoin price data  
2. Visualize trends, volatility, and correlations  
3. Engineer relevant features (e.g., moving averages, lags)  
4. Train a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
5. Evaluate prediction accuracy on test data  
6. Plot actual vs. predicted prices


## 🚀 How to Run

### Requirements

Install required Python packages via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
```

### Run the Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open `bitcoin-prediction.ipynb`  
3. Run the notebook cells in order 


## ✅ Project Status

⚠️ **Finished, but not functional**  
The implementation is complete, but the prediction output does not work as intended.   
It can be extended with more advanced models (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) or real-time data integration.
